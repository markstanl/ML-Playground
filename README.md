# Machine Learning Playground
This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. The purpose of this repository is to provide a playground for experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and techniques. The algorithms are implemented from scratch and are intended to be used for educational purposes.

There are a few files here that are made entirely with, or in addition to, ChatGPT and other LLMs. I credit them in the files themselves.
That is only to help me visualize some ideas.
